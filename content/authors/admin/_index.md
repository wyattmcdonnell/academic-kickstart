I trained in systems immunology of the adaptive immune system at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, where I earned my PhD and MSc in microbiology and immunology. Currently, I work on the most exciting single-cell chemistry and tools to study T cells and B cells at single-cell resolution at 10x Genomics.

I'm a founder and executive, an [inventor](https://patents.google.com/?inventor=Wyatt+James+McDonnell,Wyatt+McDonnell,James+Wyatt+MCDONNELL&sort=new), and immunologist. Currently I'm the CEO and co-founder of [Infinimmune](https://infinimmune.com), a venture-backed antibody biotechnology company. I also spent a few years at [10x Genomics](https://10xgenomics.com), where I launched the BEAM product (check out [the BEAM product sheet from 10x](https://pages.10xgenomics.com/rs/446-PBO-704/images/10x_LIT000195_Product_Sheet_BEAM_Letter_digital.pdf) or [Keith Robison's blog post](http://omicsomics.blogspot.com/2021/02/more-details-on-10xs-sample-profiling.html)), worked on Immune Profiling v2, and developed therapeutic and core intellectual property. 

I think antibodies and the adaptive immune system are the singular most powerful and interesting product of evolution. My academic background is in human adaptive immunology and disease thereof. You can find my most recent work on [my Google Scholar profile](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=DclwmYAAAAAJ&hl=en).
